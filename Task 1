4.Difference between waterfall and agile methodology in SDLC?
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next. 
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, focusing on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It values adaptability and delivering working software frequently.
The main differences between Agile and Waterfall methodologies:
1.	Flexibility: Agile is adaptable to change, while Waterfall follows a rigid, predefined plan.
2.	Project Phases: Agile emphasizes iterative progress, while Waterfall divides the project into distinct phases.
3.	Customer Involvement: Agile encourages continuous customer feedback, while Waterfall typically involves customers at the beginning and end of the project.
4.	Documentation: Agile focuses on working software, while Waterfall emphasizes comprehensive documentation.
5.	Risk Management: Agile allows for early identification and mitigation of risks, while Waterfall may not reveal risks until later in the project.
